Depositing information and structures related to location of receptor binding sites in various HA structures

You can consult the link below for informatin regarding the numbering system of residues of influenza virus
http://www.antigenic-cartography.org/surveillance/evergreen/HAnumbering/

Note however that not all PDBs have number their residues consistent with this numbering. It is possible to see
for instance H5 structures which are numbered like H3 structures.
