# Info:

This is the structure that is coloured in Bjorns paper [1]. Also shown is the RBS from the original definition in [2].

# Color coding:

Image1: Green: sites marked as those that lead to antigenic change in [1], yellow: sites marked as "near RBS" in [1]

![Image1](Image1.png)

Image2: Yellow: sites whose sidechains interact with the receptor, Red: sites whose main chains interact with the receptor [2]

![Image2](Image2.png)

Image3: Yellow: sites involved in receptor binding (note that this is H6). [3]
